                    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
                    <p>My full name is: Kristjana Eleny Cela but in school no one could really pronounce my name, and so
                        Krissy seemed more fitting! My surname is pronounced CH&ndash;EL&ndash;A like Bella but CH at the start
                        instead of the B.</p>
                    <p>I truly believe that my purpose in life is to help women around the world become healthier,
                        mentally and physically.</p>
                    <p>One of my biggest dreams is to host a world tour where I can train as many of you as possible and
                        we can smash our workouts together.</p>

                    <h2>My story</h2>
                    <p>My own fitness journey started 5 years ago, at the time I was studying for my law degree, so I
                        had never really considered fitness as a career, it was merely a way of escaping my worries and
                        stress.</p>
                    <p>While working out one day I asked a friend to record me doing a glute kickback, I was sure I was
                        doing it wrong, and I was right, I was! I started filming my workouts so I could see where I
                        needed to make adjustments.</p>
                    <p>One day I decided to track all my progress on social media, this way I could hold myself
                        accountable, and before I knew it the community on my page grew into a social empire!</p>

                    <h2>Krissy Fact #1</h2>
                    <p>I love doughnuts &amp; brownies, all types of doughnuts &amp; brownies, just give me them all to me
                        please!</p>

                    <h2>Krissy Fact #2</h2>
                    <p>I can safely admit, that I am addicted to working! Being a fitness trainer, it never feels like
                        work, it is my passion and love.</p>

                    <h2>Krissy Fact #3</h2>
                    <p>I've an obsession with organisation and cleaning, I've had some say it’s OCD, but personally
                        think it’s just me being me.</p>

                    <h2>My activewear brand &ndash; Oner Active</h2>
                    <p>When I first started my fitness journey I used to get I angry at the fact that I couldn’t lift
                        heavier than 30kg on the squat rack... comparing myself constantly to others I forgot to allow
                        myself the time to TRUST TGE PROCESS AND JOURNEY. Fast forward now I can lift 100kg barbell
                        squat for five reps and that’s something I’m proud of.</p>
                    <p>What I’m basically trying to say is&hellip; what you see is not how it started. Behind the scenes when
                        nobody is looking is where the magic truly happens. <a href="https://eu.oneractive.com/"
                            target="_blank">ONERACTIVE</a> was started with one vision in mind&hellip; to simply make
                        activewear that was SIMPLE/ COMFORTABLE &amp; TO THE POINT. I designed my first sports bra myself
                        and it was not the best&hellip; five attempts later and a year of trial and error&hellip; I think we’ve
                        nailed it.</p>
