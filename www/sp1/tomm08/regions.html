                <h2>Minsk</h2>
                <p>Minsk will almost certainly surprise you. The capital of Belarus is, contrary to its dreary
                    reputation, a progressive, modern and clean place. Fashionable cafes, impressive restaurants and
                    crowded nightclubs vie for your attention, while sushi bars and art galleries have taken up
                    residence in a city centre once totally remodelled to the tastes of Stalin. Despite the strong
                    police presence and obedient citizenry, Minsk is a thoroughly pleasant place that's easy to become
                    fond of.</p>
                <p>Razed to the ground in WWII, Minsk has precious few buildings remaining from the pre-war years, and
                    there are relatively few traditional sights in the city, save a clutch of worthwhile museums.
                    Instead, there are myriad places of interest to anyone fascinated by the Soviet and Lukashenko
                    periods and a wealth of cosmopolitan pursuits to keep you entertained come evening.</p>

                <h2>Brest</h2>
                <p>If you've already visited Minsk, you might think you've landed in another country when you get off
                    the train in Brest. This prosperous and cosmopolitan border town looks far more to the neighbouring
                    EU than to Minsk. It has plenty of charm and performed a massive DIY job on itself prior to its
                    millennial celebrations in 2019.</p>
                <p>The city's main sight is the Brest Fortress, a vast and moving WWII memorial. But there are also a
                    few good museums, more than a few attractive churches and a lively central pedestrianised walking
                    street, vul Savetskaya. The impressive Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park is also nearby.</p>
                <p>Brest and the city of Hrodna to the north can now be visited visa-free for 10 days</a> if arriving
                    overland from Poland, provided you secure the proper paperwork.</p>

                <h2>Grodno</h2>
                <p>With plenty of intact pre-WW2 architecture, Hrodna (Grodno in Russian) is arguably Belarus' prettiest
                    city. It has a decidedly European flavour, much of it derived from its central pedestrianised
                    street, ironically named vul Savetskaya (Soviet St). The Soviets demolished many of the city's
                    beautiful old churches after the war. Several have been rebuilt since, and their baroque profiles
                    now dominate the central skyline.</p>
                <p>Grodno is a laid-back, friendly city with a host of good bars and cafes. You can visit the city
                    overland from Poland or Lithuania without a visa, just play by the
                    rules and do not wander outside the fairly limited confines of Hrodna district (<em>rayon</em>).</p>

                <h2>Mogilev</h2>
                <p>Talking about Mogilev is some kind of magic: it makes you fall in love with it again and again with
                    each story. With all its modern modesty, the city could have become the capital once. Over the years
                    Mahilioŭ collected lots of stories and urban legends. Alexander Pushkin poured the street with
                    champagne from the balcony in the city center, Fedor Shalyapin appeared on the stage of the oldest
                    theater of Belarus, and Nikolai II watched the war chronicles here.</p>
                <p>Although life in modern Mahilioŭ lags behind life in a metropolis, but it also rushes forward,
                    erasing obsolete locations and breathing life into new ones. Exhibitions in underground passages,
                    under bridges and in garages, mechanical troubadour Mogislav in a snow-white town hall and festivals
                    of soap bubbles and draniki: all this is possible here in Mahilioŭ.

                <h2>Homel</h2>
                <p>Homel is a city to slow down & relax. Walk along beautiful Savieckaja Street with interesting
                    architecture, cross the longest bridge in Belarus and chill on the beach. There're lots of cozy
                    parks, hidden streets, and peaceful corners.</p>

                <h2>Vitebsk</h2>
                <p>The historic city of Vitebsk (known universally outside Belarus by its Russian name, Vitebsk) lies a
                    short distance from the Russian border and almost 300km from Minsk. Vitsebsk was an important centre
                    of Jewish culture when it was one of the major cities of the 'Pale of Settlement', where Jews were
                    allowed to live in the Russian Empire.</p>
                <p>The city was immortalised in the early work of Marc Chagall, the city's most famous son. He grew up
                    and studied here before moving to St Petersburg, where his artistic career began to take off. Today
                    it's an agreeable regional centre with pedestrianised vul Suvorova at its heart, along with several
                    fine churches and museums, including two dedicated to Chagall.</p>
