        <div class="box-Minsk">

            <h2>Minsk</h2>
            <p>Minsk is where you must arrive and depart to take advantage of a new 30-day visa-free regime. The capital
                has a pulsing nightlife, excellent museums and an impressive ensemble of Stalin-era architecture. Minsk
                has also become a hub for global summits and sporting events such as the 2019 European Games.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-Mir">
            <h2>Mir Castle</h2>
            <p>The 16th-century Mir Castle, reflected magnificently in an adjoining pond, resembles something
                straight out of Disney. A recent renovation has the place looking simply lovely, with gorgeous
                grounds and impressively restored interiors that have been converted into a museum with beautifully
                done displays on the life and times of the Radziwills. Definitely splash out for the audioguide,
                which offers fascinating descriptions of more than 120 items.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-Dududki">
            <h2>Dudutki</h2>
            <p>The Dudutki Ethnological Museum Complex is a “living museum” located outside of Minsk. The complex
                includes a courtyard with a creamery (where you can sample handmade cheese!), a pottery workshop, and an
                area where you can learn how people forged horseshoes and armor. You can also try Samorgon, which is a
                potent moonshine only made in the Dudutki territory. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-Nesvizh">
            <h2>Nesvizh Castle</h2>
            <p>This 17th-century fortress with a mix of Baroque and Renaissance architecture. Like the Mir Castle, this
                is another former home of the Radziwill family. Complete with traditional English rose gardens, visitors
                are free to explore the gardens and the castle interior. Inside is a picturesque central courtyard
                surrounded by the castle’s yellow walls. Inside, you’ll see antique furniture, reception rooms,
                bedrooms, family portraits, and the Radziwill family tombs in the adjoining Catholic church.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-Puscha">
            <h2>Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park</h2>
            <p>Spanning from Belarus to Poland, Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park is one of the few places in the
                world that you can see European Bison in their natural habitat, as well as the Eurasian elk. There are
                numerous hiking and biking trails in the park; take the four-mile (six-kilometer) Dokudovo route for the
                best chance of seeing the bison.</p>
