                    <h2>1. Belarusians are extremely hospitable</h2>
                    <p>Belarusians are known for their modesty, kindness and hospitability. Everybody is eager to offer
                        help to tourists and visitors (except perhaps some moody salespeople in tiny village stores).
                    </p>
                    <h2>2. It’s got an ancient fairy-tale forest</h2>
                    <p>The biggest old-growth European forest – Belovezhskaya Pushcha – is situated in Belarus. Home to
                        European bison and hundreds of other animals and birds, Belovezhskaya Pushcha is all that
                        remains of the primeval forest that once stretched across the vast European Plain. Some oak
                        trees growing in this forest are more than 600 years old. However, Belovezhskaya Pushcha is
                        noteworthy for more than just its age – on December 8, 1991, the leaders of Belarus, Russia and
                        Ukraine signed the agreement for the dissolution of the Soviet Union in a hunting lodge in the
                        forest.</p>
                    <h2>3. Russian language prevails in communication</h2>
                    <p>Both Belarusian and Russian are considered official languages, but only around 10% of citizens
                        use Belarusian in everyday communication. Many inhabitants speak trasianka – a mixture of
                        Belarusian and Russian.</p>

                    <h2>4. Belarusians take cleanliness seriously</h2>
                    <p>It’s pretty hard to find rubbish on Belarusian streets – cleanliness prevails everywhere from the
                        largest town to the smallest village. This can be explained by the abundance of trash bins,
                        which are diligently used by citizens and the country’s many street cleaners.
                    </p>
                    <h2>5. Potatoes are a dietary staple</h2>
                    <p>Potato is considered the second bread in Belarus. Locals can cook an incredible choice of over
                        100 dishes from this humble vegetable, and draniki – a potato pancake – is one of the most
                        famous specialities. Belarusians consume more potatoes per head than any other country – an
                        estimated 180kg, which amounts to around half a kilogram a day. Belarusian scientists often
                        invent new types of potato, varying in taste, colour and size.</p>

                    <h2>6. It’s the perfect place for treasure seekers</h2>
                    <p>It’s said that Belarus may have the largest amount of buried treasure in Europe hidden beneath
                        its earth, due to the countless wars that have occurred on its territory.
                    </p>
                    <h2>7. National flag refers to the country landscape</h2>
                    <p>Nearly half of Belarusian territory is made up of forests – this fact is symbolised by the green
                        stripe on the country’s flag. Belarus is sometimes called the ‘Lungs of Europe’ for its
                        countless forests, rivers and lakes, so if you’re a fan of exploring beautiful natural
                        landscapes, Belarus is the place for you.</p>
                    <h2>8.You’ll never leave a Belarusian home hungry
                    </h2>
                    <p>If you visit a local family, make sure you’re hungry as more likely you’ll be offered all the
                        food they have in the fridge. After the feast of the main meal, it’s traditional to offer guests
                        cups of black or green tea with sweets to finish. If that wasn’t enough, the female of the
                        household will present you with even more food to take with you on your journey home.</p>
