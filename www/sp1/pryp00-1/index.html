                        <h3>Microgrids and Hybrid Power Generation</h3>
                        <p>Microgrids are becoming increasingly popular because of the rapid rise in power demand due to
                            population and industrial growth. In many locations, the current mains grid system is unable
                            to
                            cope
                            with the increase in power demands. That´s why businesses, governments and even some
                            individuals
                            have begun to resort to generating their own power, to ensure reliability, but also to gain
                            more
                            control over rapidly rising electricity prices.</p>
                        <p>Islands are also becoming increasingly interesting in microgrids because of the above
                            increasing
                            demands, but also because the difficulty of obtaining electricity from the main island, (or
                            mainland) electricity grid system.</p>
                        <p>The increase in the price of diesel, and the associated costs of diesel transportation to
                            isolated
                            island communities, has also let to the development of local microgrids into Hybrid
                            PV/Diesel
                            Microgrid Systems.</p>

                        <h3>White Paper: Integration of Battery Energy Storage Systems into Hybrid Microgrids and Use of
                            LiFePO4
                            Technology</h3>
                        <p>The installation of a battery system is not critical for microgrids that are connected to the
                            electricity network. The NinjaOx control system automatically starts and synchronizes backup
                            motor
                            generators, so in case of an impending mains failure and subsequent limited power supply, a
                            backup
                            power supply would be switched on as soon as possible, without the power outage. However, in
                            parallel applications, backup batteries can also play a role of uninterruptable power supply
                            (UPS),
                            where they feed the load until the motor generator starts (can be used in critical
                            applications,
                            such as hospitals, data centers, etc.).</p>
                        <p>For island systems (so-called off-grid) with renewable resources, where diesel fuel
                            consumption
                            reduction is a priority, the usage of batteries is crucial. A high-capacity battery (not
                            only in
                            the
                            role of UPS) is then available to cover power peaks and to eliminate the need for dynamic
                            spinning
                            reserve. Thanks to that, the load of the motor generator remains constant, thus extending
                            its
                            life
                            and reducing fuel consumption.</p>
                        <p>The above mentioned can be applied only on condition that the battery is dimensioned
                            correctly,
                            and a
                            suitable technology is chosen which can reduce diesel consumption by limiting the operation
                            of
                            diesel engine generators. During the project design an economic return on investment has to
                            be
                            taken
                            into account though since the battery storage is still relatively expensive.</p>
