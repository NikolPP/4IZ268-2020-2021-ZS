                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>By 1997, Mari Kuraishi and Dennis Whittle were convinced many key innovations 
                        in global development weren’t getting the attention they deserved. Believing 
                        there had to be a better way to do aid, they started an experiment. In February 2000,
                        they invited any social entrepreneur to pitch his or her earth-changing idea at the
                        World Bank. The 300+ participants ranged from a group of NASA scientists to a 
                        woman who’d never before left her Ugandan village.</p>

                <p>The event was a success, and Mari and Dennis realized good ideas can
                        come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. They also realized there were
                        many others who wanted to support good ideas. So they left the Bank to 
                        launch the world’s first crowdfunding community in 2002. Today, people
                        in more than 165 countries can easily share their ideas, and
                        individual donors and companies can easily support vetted nonprofits through GlobalGiving.</p>

                <h2>GlobalGiving Field Teams </h2>
                <p>GlobalGiving Field Teams evaluate our partner organizations to ensure donations in our community
                    are used responsibly. They also conduct training workshops around the world to help local
                    nonprofits (including those who haven’t yet joined GlobalGiving) develop online fundraising capacity.
                    From the mountains of Nepal to the shores of Ecuador, we’re committed to visiting our partners
                    in-person to learn more about the cultures, sectors, and challenges that nonprofits face every day.
                    This helps GlobalGiving stay more responsive in meeting our partners’ needs.</p>

                <h2>GlobalGiving Fellows Program</h2>
                <p>The GlobalGiving Fellows Program offers young professionals the opportunity to learn how 
                    a thriving international NGO operates. As a fellow, you will get hands-on, practical
                     experience and opportunities to explore the field of international development. 
                     The program is a highly selective, full-time service year that will challenge and
                     inspire you, but also require hard work and dedication. You will have the opportunity
                     to explore various areas that interest you, so you can capitalize on your experience.
                     You'll be a vital contributor to our team, not getting coffee or filing papers all day long.</p>
