                    <h2>3 Benefits of Skipping</h2>
                    <h3>19.november 2020</h3>
                    <h4>It’s cheap and can be done ANYWHERE!</h4>
                    <p>Once you’ve purchased your jump rope, every workout is effectively free! Plus, it is small enough
                        to fit in any bag and given you can take it anywhere, it means you can skip anywhere! So long as
                        you have space to swing that rope without taking someone’s eye out, you can complete a high
                        intensity, full body workout from home, the gym or the park! I’d even put it in my work bag and
                        take 10 minutes for a bit of cardio at lunchtime!</p>
                    <h4>It releases positive endorphins</h4>
                    <p>Due to its pace and nature, skipping releases endorphins that set you up for the day and put you
                        in a good mood. You will feel energised and motivated after a skipping workout whether it is 10
                        minutes or 30 minutes!</p>
                    <h4>It is a full body workout</h4>
                    <p>You use your arms, legs and core when skipping. Whereas with running and cycling predominantly
                        focusing on lower body muscles, skipping makes you engage every muscle and the intensity of it
                        is great no matter what your fitness level or goal is.</p>

                    <h2>How Often You Should Workout per Week?</h2>
                    <h3>7.september 2020</h3>
                    <h4>Are there benefits from working out more? Or does quality outweigh quantity?</h4>
                    <p>The answer can be very simple: you do what works for you and your lifestyle. Depending on the
                        logistics of day to day life, you may find you have enough time to train 5 times a week, or you
                        may find 3 times a week is all you need to feel fit, healthy and energetic. Your weekly routine
                        depends on your goals and what you would like to achieve. In order to make this decision, we
                        recommend thinking carefully about your weekly schedule and choosing a plan that you will be
                        able to not only complete, but stick to. It’s very important that you don’t overestimate the
                        time you have as you will be less likely to stick to your workout schedule past the first couple
                        of weeks.</p>
                    <p>Our philosophy is to simplify fitness and nutrition to make it accessible and achievable for all
                        women. Choosing between the 3 and 5 day plan should be simple too. The questions to ask yourself
                        are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> - How much time a week do I have to train?</li>
                        <li> - How many days a week can I commit to training?</li>
                        <li> - What do I want to achieve from exercise?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you have a couple of hours to spare on a daily basis, the 5 day plan is for you. If you have
                        roughly a couple of hours across the week to spare, then opt for the 3 day plan. As much as the
                        workouts are different, you need to allow between 45 minutes - 1 hour to complete each one.
                        However, always remember any form of exercise is better than no exercise, so if you find you are
                        struggling to achieve your plan, you may want to try changing it as opposed to stopping
                        altogether. </p>
